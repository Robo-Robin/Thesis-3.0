Like a dog that refuses to drop a ball, it catches in your teeth, and you claw at it for all you're worth, nails scraping against the concrete as the pull comes. 

Life tears it from your grasp easily. 
Thus, you must let go
Let go. Let go.
Let go. Let go.
Let go. Let go.
Let go. Let go.
Let go. Let go.
Let go. Let go.
Let go. Let go.

You must be tired. You have to be. For all the hanging on - the delicate balancing act that sustained your existence. 

There's a festival somewhere. Celebrating new beginnings, celebrating becoming something else. You're not a part of it. No, you're here, with me. Instead we have all these fucking dead leaves and rotting detritus. It's not new if its been there for months. 

A tuneless whistle on the wind as you stare up into the sky. Becoming aware of your tongue, how often you blink, your breathing, your heart beating faintly in your chest. 

I can't stop you from forgetting how to live. 
All I can say, over and over is goodbye, and I'm sorry. 
and 
thank you. 

This is the end.
